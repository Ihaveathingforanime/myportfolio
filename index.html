    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>My name is Paul-Chinda Valerie Chimburuoma. I'm currently a graduate of University of Nigeria, Nsukka with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional and frontend web developer. I'm a very fast and diligent learner in the technology field, as well as a critical thinker in the face of problems or issues. I'm also a very good communicator and collaborator. I've taken a few online lessons on web development and cybersecurity through w3schools and Coursera, and I have a few personal projects that make use of the lessons I've learnt.</p>
